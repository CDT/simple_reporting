# Prompt


> “You are a senior full-stack engineer.
> Generate code and architecture for a Vue 3 + Tailwind + Node.js application that builds SQL-based Excel reports similar to FineReport, but simpler. No visual designer — only reusable components for table rendering, parameter input, and Excel export. Implement modular back-end routes (`/api/query`, `/api/export`) and a Vue front-end with ReportTable and ExportButton components. Use ExcelJS for WYSIWYG exports. Provide full folder structure, key code files, and a working example report template.”
